# Typing-Game
Using multithreading to create a simple typing game on C. 
The game allows the user 10 seconds to type the sentence shown on the screen. If the user gets it right, the game moves on to the next sentence, and the user then has 9 seconds to type the sentence. 
If the user makes a mistake or runs out of time, the game interrupts the chance and allows the user 3 chances to type the same sentence. 
If the user cannot type the sentence in 3 attemps, the game terminates. 
This game was designed as a class project for CIT595 at Upenn, with Prof. Chris Murphy
